# Multiplayer_Game_with_python
 Creating a multiplayer game using socket programming and pygame


## Note !! Some images in this game are taken from [hasbro](https://www.hasbro.com/common/documents/dad261471c4311ddbd0b0800200c9a66/A891A1C65056900B107F73766FF4C2B3.pdf). The game has been created purely for education and personal enjoyment. I do not have any commercial purpose.


## Note! First of all, this game is not played over two different internet networks. The necessary and sufficient condition for playing over two different internet networks is to move the server to a different area. So we need to buy a domain and make it a server. You can only play this game from devices on the same network.
# How to play the game

### for game rules [hasbro](https://www.hasbro.com/common/documents/dad261471c4311ddbd0b0800200c9a66/A891A1C65056900B107F73766FF4C2B3.pdf)

In order to play the game, a person needs to run the tkserver.exe or tkserver.py file on the server's own computer. Note: tkserver is visualized via tkinter. 
> pip install tkinter

Then enter the Entry port and start the server.

Then both players need to run BattleShip_1.exe or BattleShip_1.py. New Game and Join Game button will appear. The player who started the server should press the New Game button and the other player should press the Join Game button. In the Join Game section, enter the IP4 address of the person who created the server and the port number specified in the clientip section and the port section, and then the OK button should be pressed.
